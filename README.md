# Time Tracker CLI

Command line time tracker application.

Create different categories that you'd like to be spending time on (e.g. Programming, Running, Knife Throwing, etc.) and track the time you spend on them. Allows starting and stopping a timer, manually adding new records, showing progress towards a specific time goal, and a percentage breakdown by each category of the total time spent.

Currently, the time goal is hardcoded to 100 hours, but future versions will allow setting custom goals for each category.
