# Time Tracker CLI

Command line time tracker application.

Create different categories that you'd like to be spending time on (e.g. Programming, Running, Knife Throwing, etc.) and track the time you spend on them. Allows starting and stopping a timer, manually adding new records, showing progress towards a specific time goal, and a percentage breakdown by each category of the total time spent.

In progress:
A "level-up" system! Gain levels in each category based on the amount of time you spend on them. Early levels
require less time, but as you get high level, each level takes more time. Can see a progress meter showing
how far into the next level you are.
